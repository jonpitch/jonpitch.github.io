Here's the recap of the battle of the mobile platforms:

* [Development Tools]({{< ref "/posts/development-battle-android-vs-ios/part-1-development-tools" >}} "development tools"): `Android`
* [Code]({{< ref "/posts/development-battle-android-vs-ios/part-2-code" >}} "code"): `Draw`
* [Testing]({{< ref "/posts/development-battle-android-vs-ios/part-3-testing-debugging" >}} "testing and debugging"): `Draw`
* [Deployment and metrics]({{< ref "/posts/development-battle-android-vs-ios/part-4-deployments-analytics-metrics" >}} "deployments and metrics"): `Android`

For me, the winner was Android. I did my best to be objective, though it's very possible that my experience with Android biased my opinions regardless. I think it's important to note that while I prefer developing for Android, iOS is still very necessary.

I would love to hear other developers opinions on both platforms, especially if you have been a long time iOS developer who had to port an application to Android. Did you have a similar experience or a completely different one?
