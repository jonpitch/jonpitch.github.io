For the better part of 6 years, I have soley been an Android advocate, ignoring iOS at whatever cost. In the last few years, I have been working on a side project (formerly brausr.com) that I thought would benefit from being on both platforms. Over the next series of posts, I'm going to compare and contrast my experience building the same application on both platforms.

I will try at great lengths to keep my Android/Google bias and anti-Apple opinions in check, but do keep that in mind when reading. I'll weight the pros and cons of each specific topic, pick a winner and then see who wins in the end. The winner will take home a fabulous prize. My topics for comparison will include:

* [Part 1: Development Tools]({{< ref "/posts/development-battle-android-vs-ios/part-1-development-tools" >}} "development tools")
* [Part 2: Code]({{< ref "/posts/development-battle-android-vs-ios/part-2-code" >}} "code")
* [Part 3: Testing & Debugging]({{< ref "/posts/development-battle-android-vs-ios/part-3-testing-debugging" >}} "testing and debugging")
* [Part 4: Deployment, analytics & metrics]({{< ref "/posts/development-battle-android-vs-ios/part-4-deployments-analytics-metrics" >}} "deployments and metrics")
* [Part 5: Summary]({{< ref "/posts/development-battle-android-vs-ios/part-5-summary" >}} "summary")
