title: Development Battle &mdash; Android vs. iOS
---

For the better part of 6 years, I have soley been an Android advocate, ignoring iOS at whatever cost. In the last few years, I have been working on a <a href="http://brausr.com">side project</a> that I thought would benefit from being on both platforms. Over the next series of posts, I'm going to compare and contrast my experience building the same application on both platforms.

I will try at great lengths to keep my Android/Google bias and anti-Apple opinions in check, but do keep that in mind when reading. I'll weight the pros and cons of each specific topic, pick a winner and then see who wins in the end. The winner will take home a fabulous prize. My topics for comparison will include:

* [Part 1: Development Tools](/2015/02/21/development-battle-android-vs-ios-part1/)
* [Part 2: Code](/2015/03/16/development-battle-android-vs-ios-part2/)
* Part 3: Testing & debugging (*coming soon*)
* Part 4: Deployment (*coming soon*)
* Part 5: Post-deployment analytics & metrics (*coming soon*)
* Part 6: Summary (*coming soon*)
