title: Development Battle &mdash; Android vs. iOS
---

For the better part of 6 years, I have soley been an Android advocate, ignoring iOS at whatever cost. In the last few years, I have been working on a <a href="http://brausr.com">side project</a> that I thought would benefit from being on both platforms. Over the next series of posts, I'm going to compare and contrast my experience building the same application on both platforms.

I will try at great lengths to keep my Android/Google bias and anti-Apple opinions in check, but do keep that in mind when reading. My topics for comparison will include:

* Development tools (*coming soon*)
* Code (*coming soon*)
* Testing & debugging (*coming soon*)
* Deployment (*coming soon*)
* Post-deployment analytics & metrics (*coming soon*)
