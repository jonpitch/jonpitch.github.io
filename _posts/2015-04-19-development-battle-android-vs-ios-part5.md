title: Development Battle &mdash; Android vs. iOS &#45; Part 5&#58; Summary
tags: [android, ios, mobile]

Here's the recap of the battle of the mobile platforms:

* [Development Tools](/2015/02/21/development-battle-android-vs-ios-part1/): `Android`
* [Code](/2015/03/16/development-battle-android-vs-ios-part2/): `Draw`
* [Testing](/2015/03/24/development-battle-android-vs-ios-part3/): `Draw`
* [Deployment and Metrics](/2015/04/19/development-battle-android-vs-ios-part4/): `Android`

For me, the winner was Android. I did my best to be objective, though it's very possible that my experience with Android biased my opinions regardless. I think it's important to note that while I prefer developing for Android, iOS is still very necessary.

I would love to hear other developers opinions on both platforms, especially if you have been a long time iOS developer who had to port an application to Android. Did you have a similar experience or a completely different one?
