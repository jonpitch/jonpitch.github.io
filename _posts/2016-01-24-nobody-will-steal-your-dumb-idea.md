> Hey, you make apps, right?

Ugh, yeah, sure, I *make apps*.

> I have an awesome idea, want to hear it?

Not particularly, but sure.

> What if there was Uber for &lt;insert something ridiculous here&gt;, plus drones, for your phone...also internet of things!

Sorry, I spaced out there for a second. So I just Googled your idea, turns out there's already 3-4 competing products. Why don't you use one of those?

> Bro, drones! Also my UI will be better.

Sure it will. What's the current market like? Do you have a business plan? How are you going to market your idea? How will you make money?

> That's a lot of hard questions. I know at least a half dozen people who thought this was a good idea.

Aside from your mom, will those five people pay for it?

> Totally.

So no.

> Come on man, it won't be that complicated to write. Help me out and I'll cut you in for like 50%.

So, I get to do 99% of the work for 50% of the "revenue"? That sounds awesome. How do you know it won't be that complicated, why don't you write it then? Just because an app cost `$0.99` doesn't mean it won't take a fair amount of effort. I also have a day job and a life. If I'm following along, I get to sacrifice all the precious free time I do have to work on your idea that isn't even half baked for a non-majority of the revenue?

You do realize that ideas aren't worth anything, right? Execution is everything.

> Whatever dude, just don't steal my idea.

Trust me, I'm not going to steal your dumb fucking idea.
