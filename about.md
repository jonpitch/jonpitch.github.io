At the beginning of time, a massive burst of energy gave way to what would eventually become me, Jon Pitcherella. For millions of years since that epic event, I wandered the earth fighting crime and solving mysteries.

These days, I lead a much more humble life. I reside in [West Chester](https://www.google.com/maps/place/West+Chester,+PA), where I write awesome software, brew beer and live the dream.
